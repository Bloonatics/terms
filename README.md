# Terms of Service

By using our services (Bloony Bot), you agree to our Terms of Service. If you disagree with any parts of of this Terms of Service, you do not have permission to use our service. We ([developer][Bloonatics] team) reserve the right to update this Terms of Service at any time.

We strictly comply with Discord's [Terms of Service][DiscordToS] and [Discord Developer Terms of Service][DiscordDevToS].

## Accuracy, Improvements and Stability
We do not have responsibility for any damages caused by unexpected errors, inaccurate content and downtime, or any exceptions. We are not responsible for maintaining the services permanently. Our services are not absolutely stable, durable and invulnerable. You agree to this and we can update our content and features at any time.

## Termination
By using our services, you agree to these rules. If you violate any rules, we reserve the right to take actions ranging from temporary blacklist to even permanently remove your access to all of our services.

###### Rule One - Auto Typer
Userbotting, macros, scripts and anything else used to automate running commands are strictly prohibited. This rule applies to all traditional commands, application commands and message components.

###### Rule Two - Spamming
Spamming is a bannable offense, please avoid running multiple commands in a short period of time. Any types of spam including traditional commands and application commands abuse, auto responses abuse or even excessively clicking message components (buttons and select menus) are punishable.

###### Rule Three - User Friendly Environment
You will be penalised for inputting content which contains Racism, Homophobia, Sexism, Slurs, NSFW and Discrimination. None of these things should ever be tolerated. It includes creating cancerous auto response, naming anything with banned words, etc. We reserve the right to remove partial data or even remove your access to use any systems so as to maintain an user-friendly environment.

###### Rule Four - System Abuse And Database Sustainability
Abusing our systems by wasting our data storage resources will not be tolerated. For example, inappropriate use of CSMS report handling system, create unnecessary workload to our system by adding a large amount of auto responses, etc. You will receive a partial data removal or even a permanent ban.

###### Rule Five - Respect Our Staff Members
By using our services, you have to respect our development staff and customer support team. There is no point to argue with them and complain about their decisions. If you think they did something wrong, you can report it to our Moderators, but not being rude with them. If you are caught for being toxic with our staff members, you will be punished.

###### Rule Six - Suspicious Usage And Potential Raider
Attempting to take down our system by running a large amount of commands in a short period of time is forbidden. Some raiders may invite our bot to a server with full of alts and mass running commands. Such actions are a serious violation of our bot rules and [Discord ToS][DiscordToS].

> Warning: these rules are not the only thresholds for termination. We reserve the right to take actions according to [Discord ToS][DiscordToS], [Community Guidelines][DiscordCommunityGuidelines] violations and common sense.
